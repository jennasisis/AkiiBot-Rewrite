# AkiiBot-Rewrite
A complete rewrite to my Discord Bot, Akiibot
A Discord bot for fun, moderation, and probably maybe some other stuff I dunno.

Hi, I'm Samir, or Akii as some of you know me. I do things. I'm also making a bot.

## So what's this all about?
It's just a bot, I mean, nothing really special about it.
## Can I have one?
Uh, sure? You would have to re-code 99% of it so that it matched what you needed. I am working on a public version, though. Stay tuned ;)
## HEY, YOU COULD DO THIS BETTER!
Ok, jeez, calm down, i'm still learning. Just open up a [pull request](https://github.com/jennasisis/AkiiBot-Rewrite/pulls).
## HEY, THIS IS WRONG AND DOESN'T WORK!
Alright, open up an [issue](https://github.com/jennasisis/AkiiBot-Rewrite/issues), I'll see what I can do.
